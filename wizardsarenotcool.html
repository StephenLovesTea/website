 <p>Or are you looking for something to play?<br>
In either case, we got you covered.</p>


<u><h1>Gameplay</h1></u>

<p>You are the knight, and you gotta dodge wizard spells. Simple as that.<br>
Bad news, there might be a few complications on the job. Your movement is limited by a grid, which changes dimensions every so often, and there are multiple wizard types, and they shoot different types of super evil magic.<br>
Good news, the cool knight gods bless you every so often with goodsies (like bandages and swords).</p>

<u><h1>A few last words</h1></u>
<p>The project is still in developement, so expect lots of changes. And take note that this is a hobby project, so it might not be finished in the near future, if at all.<br>
If you have any suggestions or questions about the game, you can DM me on Discord, or send me an email at stephenlovestea@proton.me (STOP SUBSCRIBING ME TO CHRISTIAN NEWSLETTERS).</p>
